# Reinforcement Learning for Cloud Resource Allocation

This repository demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to cloud resource allocation, aiming to optimize resource usage and minimize costs. The project uses a custom environment built with OpenAI Gym and trains an agent using the PPO algorithm from the Stable-Baselines3 library.

## Project Description
Cloud resource allocation is a critical problem for optimizing computational resources, memory, and storage in cloud environments. This project uses RL to simulate and improve decision-making in resource allocation scenarios. The agent learns to allocate, deallocate, or maintain resources while balancing utilization and cost efficiency.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Stable-Baselines3.
- **OpenAI Gym**: Framework for developing the custom environment.
- **Stable-Baselines3**: Reinforcement learning library for training the agent.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the agent's performance.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rl-cloud-allocation.git
   cd rl-cloud-allocation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow gym stable-baselines3 matplotlib
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Initialize and train the RL agent:
   ```python
   from stable_baselines3 import PPO
   model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
   model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
   ```

2. Test the trained agent:
   ```python
   obs = env.reset()
   for _ in range(100):
       action, _states = model.predict(obs)
       obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action)
       print(f"State: {obs}, Reward: {rewards}")
   ```

3. Visualize the agent’s performance:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.plot(rewards_over_time)
   plt.xlabel("Time Steps")
   plt.ylabel("Reward")
   plt.title("Agent Performance Over Time")
   plt.show()
   ```

---

## Custom Environment
The custom environment `CloudEnv` simulates a simplified cloud system:

- **State**: A vector representing CPU, memory, and storage utilization (e.g., `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`).
- **Actions**:
  - `0`: Allocate resources.
  - `1`: Deallocate resources.
  - `2`: No operation (maintain current state).
- **Reward**: A combination of high resource utilization and low variance.
- **Observation Space**: Continuous values bounded between `0` and `1`.
- **Action Space**: Discrete actions.

---

## Training the Agent
The agent is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm:

1. **Environment Initialization**:
   ```python
   env = CloudEnv()
   ```

2. **Model Training**:
   ```python
   model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
   model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
   ```

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   After training, the agent’s decisions and rewards are logged and visualized.

---

## Results and Visualization
The agent’s performance is tracked over time, with rewards visualized to analyze trends and effectiveness.

## Future Improvements
1. **Dynamic Scaling**: Introduce more realistic changes in cloud resource demands.
2. **Cost Model**: Integrate a cost function for resource usage.
3. **Multi-Agent System**: Allow multiple agents to collaboratively allocate resources.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different RL algorithms and training configurations.
